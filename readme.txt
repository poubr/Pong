# Pong

Classic pong game made with python's turtle module.
NB: turtle is not the best module for this game and as a result the game is quite laggy.
Only workaround is to use different modules (will add pygame version in the future).
Due to this I stuck to only the basic functionality of the game.

Functionality

# main.py
Runs the game, sets up the screen and event listeners.

# ball.py
Creates the ball sprite and controls its bouncing.

# players.py
Creates the players' paddles and movement controls.

# score.py
Keeps track of the score and writes it on the screen.



# How to run

You need to have python interpreter installed.
Download the folder and unzip, in terminal (Mac) or command prompt (Windows)
type "python main.py".
